# Coding exercise for AI-O candidates

Please clone the repo, creat a new branch with your username and push your work after finished.

You are provided with a dataset containing some clinical information about patients that you can find at:

`./data/test-coding-a-data.csv`

The task is to build a predictive model of the event "Exitus - (Death)", that is, a model that given the information of a new patient returns a probability of that patient having a future "Exitus - (Death)" event.

The data of the new patient is supposed to be provided as a file like:

`./data/test-coding-a-data.csv`

You can build the model however you want but at the end the model must be persisted and accessed by running in a terminal the script:

`./scr/predict.py`

**This exercise is expected to be finished in less than 4 hours. We don't expect the highest accuracy but just to see how do you approach the ML problem and if you are able to produce ready-to-use code and work in a remote team.**
